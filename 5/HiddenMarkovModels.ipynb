    "Markov Chains are an extremely useful concept in probability and statistics that model the idea of future outcomes being independent of the past once you know the present. For example, this is a highly unrealistic model, but suppose you live in an imaginary world where there are only two possibilities for weather on a given day: sunny and rainy, and you are trying to predict whether it will rain tomorrow. Suppose you also know the history of the weather up to today. So, the data you have are whether it was rainy or sunny today, whether it was rainy or sunny yesterday, etc. The **Markov property** would say that if you know the weather today, none of the past history besides today can be used predict the weather tomorrow. Stating this in terms of probability:\n",

    "If you haven't seen this notation before, don't worry. By $P(\\textbf{something})$, we mean the probability that \"something\" happens, and the stuff beyond the vertical line is the past information that we have that we are conditioning on. For example, if X is the outcome you get from rolling a standard die, $P(X = 3 | X< 4) = \\frac{1}{3}$, since the possibilities are $1,2,$ and $3$. "

    "Well, what are the problems with this as a model? For one thing, it's pretty unrealisic to have weather only depend on the most recent day. But, we can solve that by expanding the state space of our markov chain; for example, we could have our $X_i$'s represent the weather from the last three days. This also isn't entirely satisfying though, since a priori, we don't really know how far back in time we want our model to go. That's where **Hidden Markov Models** are useful: we assume that the variables we observe (in this case, the weather) are dependent on some *hidden* Markov chain that we don't get to observe (in this case, some weird process that goes on up in the sky that we can't see).

So, we can think of the hidden states as the true phonemes, the $H_i$s, and the frequency of sound that we observe as the $O_i$.
