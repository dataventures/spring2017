While the inputs and outputs of our training set may be related by an underlying function, there will also be noise in the training data, and working with too many possible features can cause the model to overfit the data by learning the noise. \n",

    "Ridge regression is motivated by the idea that we can prevent overfitting by limiting the sum of the weights of the model. Intuitively, by limiting the coefficients of the regression, ridge regression causes only the most relevant features to be represented. This reduces the problem of overfitting while still allowing for the flexibility a large feature space. The problem is thus minimizing the new error function\n",

    "One potential drawback to ridge regression is that the coefficients can be made very small, but never zero. Many datasets have a sparse feature space - there can be many features, but only a few have relevant predictive power. In these cases, we want to allow some coefficients to be 0, representing that they are not relevant to the prediction in any way. Ridge regression may cause these coefficients to have very small values, but Lasso regression allows these coefficients to go to 0 - this doesn't dramatically improve predictive power over the lasso regression, but it makes it much cleaner to see what features actually contributed to the prediction. Lasso regression uses this error function\n",

    "This is the same as Ridge Regression but instead of penalizing the squares of the coefficients we penalize the absolute value of the coefficients. Feel free to read more about why this leads to some coefficients being set to 0, but we're not going to go over it here, since the mathematics is somewhat complicated. The advantage of this approach is that we simultaneously perform variable selection, which leads to more interpretable results."

    "Regularization is important, as overfitting is one of the main problems that plagues vanilla linear regression. Regularization maintains the flexibility of large feature spaces while ensuring that the large feature spaces aren't too sensitive to noise. The tuning parameter controls the sensitivity of the model to noise, and this can be tuned using cross validation to find the optimal values for the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge regression ensures small coefficients, while Lasso regression further ensures that coefficients can be zeroed out. There exist many other regularization methods out there. For example, elastic net regression is a hybrid model that combines the error terms for Ridge and Lasso regression."
