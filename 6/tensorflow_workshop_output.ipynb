    "# Tensorflow Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensorflow is a library which allows us to specify functions as computational graphs. Since Neural Nets are really just functions specified as graphs, we can use Tensorflow to deal with the low-level details of Neural Nets while we focus on the high-level architecture of the network we want to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "To start, we'll go through the basics of Tensorflow: how to use it to define computational graphs, and how to train these graphs with backpropogation to mimimize an error. After we have a hold on the basics, in the next workshop we'll use Tensorflow to create and train a neural net on the classic handwritten digits classification task. \n",

    "There are two key kinds of objects (amoung others) which Tensorflow deals with. The first is a \"placeholder\". Think of this as a kind of input variable which we have yet to specify its value. For example, $x$ is a placeholder in the expression $3x^2+5x+1$. We haven't yet specified what $x$ is yet, but once we do, we know how to evaluate the expression. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second kind of object is a \"variable\". Variables have definite, initialized values. We might try to change these values in order to reduce the error of our function on some training set. For example, imagine our function is $f(x)=ax+b$, where $x$ is a placeholder and $a,b$ are variables. We initialize $a,b$ to be values taken from a normal distribution. Now imagine we have some data $X=[1,2,3,4]$ and $Y=[2,3,4,5]$. If we represent $f$ as a Tensorflow graph, and \"train\" $f$ on the data $X$ and $Y$, this means that we want to try and find values of $(a,b)$ such that $f(1)$ is close to $2$, $f(2)$ is close to 3 etc. (i.e., essentially linear regression). In other words, we optimize the fit of our function over \"variables\", and \"placeholders\" specify our function input. Here's an example of how to use Tensorflow to define the function $f(x)=ax^2+bx+1$:"

A higher learning rate can mean faster optimization, but there's also a danger that too high a learning rate will cause the optimizer to \"overreact\" to the gradient at each step, causing some pretty bad behaviour. \n",

Try to find a trade-off between learning rate and the number of steps it takes to train the model reasonably well. If you need to re-initialize the parameters $(a,b,c)$ in your model (because the optimizer did something to them you didn't like, like setting them to infinity because the learning rate was too high), you can re-run the code block where the model was initialized to reset the values.\n"
